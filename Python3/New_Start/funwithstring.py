print(" python is easier than C ")
# python is cool ? 
print(' python is easier than c ')

# see " or ' will act as a string :) 

print('69') # ok thi is not a string lol now it is 

# one more thing when dealing with string / \ :) 

# backslash matters \

print("hello there motherfucker\'s")

# but i think if we use " " then there is no need for \ wanna see

print("hello there motherfucker's")

print('hello there motherfucker\'s')

# so these all will act as same 

""" and same goes for the "" double quotes """ 

print("this is \"awesome!\".")
