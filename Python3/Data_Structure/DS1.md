# Data Structure 

## Data :- Anything which is providing any info is data

## Structure :- re arranging the data 

data structure is the way to store and manage the data so it can be used efficiently.

# Types of data structure 

there are 2 types of data structure 

1) primitive data structure :- the data which is pre defined in the system like int,float,char

2) non-primitive data structure :- which is made when there are lots of primative structure 

now there are 2 of it 1) linear and 2) non linear

linear :- array, stack, queue, linklist

non linear :- graph, tree

L-2 

operation on data structure 

well this one is so important 

the data we have stored are store in some ways/methods we have like 

1. insertion :- add a new data in data structure
2. deletion :- removing the data from data structure 
3. sorting :- arrange data in increassing/decressing order
4. searching :- find the location of the data in DS
5. merging :- combining the data in and make it a single file
6. Traversing :- we have to visit all the data in DS

L - 3

# Arrays 

so what is array ? 

so array is an collection of an homogeneous elements. 

like we have all int in this case :- 1,4,523,7,46,854

-> array stored in specific memory location 

-> array can be store in multiple values which can be refrence by a single name like having a single variable :)

### Types of array 

1. 1-D array : it's used one subscript to define the elements of array

`data type var_name[size]`
`int num[10]; `
` char c[2]; `

initilazion of 1 - D array 

data type varname[expression] = {values};

example 

int num1[10] = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
